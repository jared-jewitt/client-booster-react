# Portable Frontend Boilerplate - React

This codebase is a boilerplate for creating React applications. It is intended to be used as a module for 
my [Launch pads](https://github.com/launch-pads). However, that being said, it can still be used completely on its own.

In order for a portable boilerplate to work with a Launch pad, it must abide by the following guidelines:
> <https://github.com/portable-boilerplates/guidelines>

This boilerplate contains the following development tooling:

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
- [Webpack](https://nodemon.io/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

#### Requirements (If not using Docker):

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

#### Developers:

- [Jared Jewitt](https://jared-jewitt.github.io/)

## Getting Started

1. Rename [.env-example](.env-example) file to `.env` and paste your desired env variables there. If you don't need env 
variables, just delete the file.

2. Run the app via either of the options below. After that, visit your app at `http://localhost:3000`.

##### Without Docker
```
npm install
npm run start
```
 
##### With Docker
```
docker build --file=Dockerfile.development --tag=portable-react:dev .
docker run -d --publish=3000:3000 --name=portable_react --volume=${PWD}:/usr/src/app --volume=/usr/src/app/node_modules portable-react:dev
```
